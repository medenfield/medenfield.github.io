      <description>At Open Angler, transactional texts and emails are an important part of how we facilitate and improve upon the process of booking a charter boat or fishing trip online.
Most web frameworks like Drupal have built in methods and modules to handle sending email, but plaintext is the default, and it&amp;rsquo;s done from the same server you host your website, generally speaking. So let&amp;rsquo;s improve upon that. This is specific to Drupal, but the general process is likely similar.</description>

      <title>Integrating Drupal 7 platform with Slack</title>

      <description>At Open Angler, we need to know when booking requests happen on our site. In the old days, a site manager might log in to a dashboard periodically, or perhaps get an email based on a customer action. These days, a push notification is probably better if time is of the essence.
We love Slack, and decided the easiest way to achieve our goal would be to just set up a simple bot that posts to a dedicated channel whenever a new booking request is created.</description>

      <description>Hello world!
This is my a personal project and portfolio site where I intend to write about new things I&amp;rsquo;m learning about programming and code. I will also revisit things I&amp;rsquo;ve created that I&amp;rsquo;m proud about and want to display publicly. Much of what is contained will be about challenging myself to accomplish X using something new, and then writing about it.
For this site, I went with Hugo - a static site generator written in Go.</description>
